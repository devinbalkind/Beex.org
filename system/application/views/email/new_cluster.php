Congratulations.  You've created a cluster on BEEx.org.  Now what!?
<br><br>
First things first:<br>
<?php echo anchor("cluster/view/".$item['id'], "You can view, edit, and delete your cluster from your cluster page here"); ?>.<br>
People can join you cluster simply by going to your cluster page and clicking 'join.'
