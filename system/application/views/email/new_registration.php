BEEx is extremely simple to use.  To start a challenge simply declare the action you'll perform if a specific amount of money is raised  for the nonprofit of your choice.
<br><br>
Example: Devin will shave his head if $1000 is raised for The Sarapis Foundation.
<br><br>
We provide you with a personal challenge page and easy social network promotion tools.  Our Facebook App and blog widgets are coming soon.

We love BEEx.org as is, but anticipate lots of improvements over the months and years as we construct an evolutionary grassroots fundraising platform.
